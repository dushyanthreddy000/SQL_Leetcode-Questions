select distinct num as ConsecutiveNums from 
(
select num,lead(num) over(order by id) as lead_num, lag(num) over (order by id) as lag_num from logs
)t
where lead_num=num and num=lag_num

solution2:

select distinct a.num as ConsecutiveNums from Logs a
join logs b on a.id = b.id+1 and a.num = b.num
join logs c on a.id = c.id+2 and a.num = c.num
